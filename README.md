# Pokemon_API
* In this project I used pokeAPI for the information about pokemons and their abilities, created a table in python and saved data there.
First of all, I asked user what is his or her favorite pokemon, then got info about that pokemon with API, structured that info with json and after those steps
found out what is that pokemon's abilities and saved those data to database.
