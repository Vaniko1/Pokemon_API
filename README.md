# Pokemon_API
* In this project I used pokeAPI for the information about pokemons and their abilities, created a table in python and saved data there.
First of all, I asked user what is his or her favorite pokemon, then got info about that pokemon with API, structured that info with json and after those steps
found out what is that pokemon's abilities, finally saved those data to database.
* At the end I have a function, which generates a random quote from a random anime and a character, I did it with the help of API... for the bonus I made a toast
, a windows notification, it shows a quote from an anime and lasts for 10 seconds!
